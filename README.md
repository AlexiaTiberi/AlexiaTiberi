## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am postdoctoral fellow in Neuroscience with a passion for data science, image analysis and creating pipelines for data analysis automatization!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Python package that allows for segmenting microglial cells, interneurons and all neurons using machine learning and computer vision to do some spatial distribution analysis in the brain! This is to understand how these cells types interact in health and disease.
